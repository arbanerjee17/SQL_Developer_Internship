# SQL Developer Internship

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains my work during the **SQL Developer Internship**, covering various database concepts such as queries, joins, subqueries, views, stored procedures, and functions.  
Each task is organized in its own folder with a **README.md** and `.sql` scripts.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
task02/ â†’ Basic SQL Queries
task03/ â†’ Filtering, Sorting, and Aggregate Functions
task04/ â†’ Grouping Data and Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY & HAVING
task05/ â†’ Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
task06/ â†’ Subqueries and Nested Queries
task07/ â†’ Creating Views
task08/ â†’ Stored Procedures and Functions


## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench** for MySQL queries
- **DB Browser for SQLite** (for some tasks)
- Sample databases created manually for each task

## ðŸ“– Tasks Summary
- **Task 02:** Writing basic SQL queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and simple conditions.  
- **Task 03:** Implementing filtering with `WHERE`, ordering with `ORDER BY`, and basic aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`).  
- **Task 04:** Using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for aggregated reporting.  
- **Task 05:** Combining data from multiple tables with different types of joins.  
- **Task 06:** Using subqueries (single-row, multi-row, correlated) for complex filtering and calculations.  
- **Task 07:** Creating and using **Views** for abstraction and security.  
- **Task 08:** Implementing **Stored Procedures** and **Functions** with parameters and conditional logic.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
- Writing clean, optimized SQL queries
- Using advanced SQL features like joins, subqueries, and views
- Creating reusable database components with stored procedures and functions
- Improving database security and abstraction using views
- Structuring SQL projects for version control and collaboration
